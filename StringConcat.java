        System.out.println(a+b+c+d);// here we get output durga102030 because at first durga & 10 both are differ type of data thats why + works as concatation operator.
        System.out.println(b+c+d+a);// here b,c,d is all same int type so + work as arithmatic operator than with durga it work as concatanation operator.
        System.out.println(b+c+a+d);// here b and c is number so output is 30durga30
        System.out.println(b+a+c+d);// here output is 10durga2030  

        // so we can say that for above cases that if print statement starÌ¥ts with string than we dont get some and we can get some of all numbers in the case of string is present in last only.
        a=b+c+d; // incompitable type because we canot assign int to string var so error we are going to get.

        b = b+c+d; // this is possible because we can see that all are int type number.
